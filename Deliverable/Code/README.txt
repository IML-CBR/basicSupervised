To test this code:
	- Everything needed is included in the main.m file, so open it
	- Read the data and build the necessary data structure executing all code until the "QUESTION BLOCK 1" line
	- Execute the code in "QUESTION BLOCK 1" to see the relation between the X and Y variables
	- Execute the code in "QUESTION BLOCK 2" to see the fitting of the data done by the linear model, obtained using the analytical method
	- Execute the code in "QUESTION BLOCK 3" to see both the convergence curve and the fitting of the data done by the linear model, obtained using the gradient descent method. A large number of plots appear, which show the results obtained by different combinations of parameters
	- Execute the code in "QUESTION BLOCK 4" to see both the convergence curve and the fitting of the data done by the linear model, obtained using the gradient descent method with the new gradient formula. A large number of plots appear, which show the results obtained by different combinations of parameters
	- Execute the code in "Comparison between the 3 methods" to see the best fitting of the data done by the three aforementioned methods at the same time
	- Execute the code in "QUESTION BLOCK 5" to see the fitting of the data done by the linear model with 2 extra parameters, obtained using the analytical method
	- Execute the code in "QUESTION BLOCK 7" to see:
		- The fitting of the train data of the 6 models obtained
		- The RMS according to 'p' in two plots with different scales to show its tendency. Those 'p' without RMS have actually a too high RMS value to be shown in the plot
	- Finally, execute the remaining code to see the weights and parameters combinations obtained
